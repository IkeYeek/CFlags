## CFlags - a simple abstraction over C bitwise flags.
#### Encoding flags on 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits <sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup> Using usual 64 bits primitive size eg.

- unsigned char for 8 bits / 1 byte
- unsigned short for 16 bits / 2 bytes
- unsigned int for 32 bits / 4 bytes
- unsigned long for 64 bits / 8 bytes

Please note this is a simple coding project to get my hands on C after a long time, I do not guarentee anything about this.
